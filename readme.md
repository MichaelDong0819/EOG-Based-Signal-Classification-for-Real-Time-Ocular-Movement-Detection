# EOG Based Signal Classification for Real Time Ocular Movement Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a program utilising a SpikerBox device to retrieve electric signals generated by the brain during eye movement. The program classifies these signals into left, right, and eyebrow raise movements to assess users' reaction capabilities while distracted by secondary tasks. Distractions, including memorizing a shopping list, solving math problems, and playing Simon Says, are presented alongside a video feed of dash cam footage displaying imminent incidents. The SpikerBox detects whether users are focused on the video or the distraction task and records their reaction time upon raising their eyebrows.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt
3. Create and activate a virtual environment: 
    ```bash
    python -m venv env

    .\env\Scripts\activate # For Windows
    # or
    source env/bin/activate # For MacOS and Linux
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt # For Python 3
    # or
    pip install -r requirements.txt # For older Python versions
    ```

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps after setting up your environment:

1. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py # For Python 3
   # or
   python main.py # For older Python versions
   ```
